## The source code structure of the neural network module
The source code of the neural network (ANN) consists of two types of files, “.h” and “.cpp”, located in ./include/ann and ./src/ann respectively. Implementing an ANN requires multiple classes; therefore, placing all of them in a single directory would be difficult to manage. In this project, the classes implementing the ANN are organized into subdirectories within ./include/ann and ./src/ann.
